# app_store_play_store

The aim of this project is to provide insights on mobile app profiles that are more likely to be successful in the App Store and Google Play store. 
The analysis is based on apps that are free and the language is in English. 
Hence, this is more helpful for developers that aim to build apps that are free and the main source of revenue would consist of in-app ads. 

The datasets used can be found here:

## Conclusion
Although Navigation apps have the highest installations in the Apple app store, there are only 6 apps, dominated by traffic navigation apps.

The Android Google Play Store has a much larger variety of navigation apps. It also seems to be dominated by traffic navigation apps and transport timing apps.

### Recommendations for app developers
Therefore, I would suggest app developers to consider creating more niche navigation apps for more targeted groups. I listed 2 examples of navigation apps below:

**Navigation apps for delivery services** 

For example, even though giants like Waze and Google Maps are widely used, they suggest routes for cars. They do not have features that consider optimal routes for other larger modes of transport like lorries or heavy trucks.
For delivery lorries/trucks, certain routes may not be accessible due to height restrictions and following Google Maps or Waze may lead to unnecessary detours as a result.

**Navigation apps for trekking/ outdoor sports such as cycling** 

In forrested areas, satellite map views may not be helpful and internet connection may be poor. Offline trail maps that show views of the route from the ground may be better. Also, not all terrains may be suited for cycling and can get more dangerous after bad weather conditions. The app could have community features that enable outdoor enthusiasts to contribute suggestions and images of trekking/cycling routes and provide recommendations on difficulty level for completion.
### Limitations
Both datasets were scraped in 2018. There may have been different trends as of 2022

The current analysis is only for English apps that are free. It is unclear if charging a price would render the app to be more profitable overall.

More research needs to be done to determine the type of navigation app to be developed
